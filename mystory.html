<h6>My Personal Story</h6>
<h2>My passion towards creating this initiative comes from my own experiences.</h2>

<p6 style="font-size: 25px;">Rohan Sharma was born on August 29th, 2006, in Etobicoke, Ontario, 
    and his motivation for creating awareness for this initiative comes 
    from the inspiration he received from his fellow classmates at Grade 
    6 in Tall Pines School. He vividly remembers the true excitement his 
    older colleagues had once they raised enough money through food drives
     and assemblies to build a school in Kenya. The impact that his peers 
     had on almost 150 children was barrier-breaking. He believes that all
      individuals have the capability of changing lives and creating 
      positive actions, including YOU. Just imagine your family member 
      living abroad dying of thirst and hunger, you’d voluntarily help as 
      much as you can. Please help our initiative because our initiative 
      is nothing with you! Each dollar and even cent matters because it 
      means so much more to someone else than it does to you. For example,
       an individual sitting at a restaurant might believe his half-full 
       glass of water is half empty, meanwhile, a thirsty individual in 
       the desert will see that glass as half-full. Please share this 
       initiative with others and always be a leader to change someone’s 
       life.</p6>
