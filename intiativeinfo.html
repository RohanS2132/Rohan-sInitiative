<h5>WE Charity's Fundraising Info & Reasons to Donate</h5>

<p22>At School (taken from the WE Charity)</p22>
<ul class = "a">
    <li>Host a fundraising event such
        as an art battle, talent show or
        concert, and collect entry fees
        as donations from students,
        families and everyone who
        comes. Remember to use social
        media to reach more people.</li>
    <li>Host a competition among
        classes and see who can raise
        $50 for the first goat and
        the most in total. Ask local
        businesses if they can donate
        a prize for the winning classes.
        or organize a celebration party.</li>
</ul>

<p22>At Home (taken from the WE Charity)</p22>
<ul class = "b">
    <li>Organize a family night where
        you discuss and learn about
        your cause, and create coin
        collection jars to bring to work
        or school to collect change.</li>
    <li>Fundraise as a family and create
        a coin collection jar at home.</li>
</ul>


<p22>As a Community (taken from the WE Charity)</p22>
<ul class = "c">
    <li>Ask local businesses and
        community centres to place
        a coin collection jar in their
        business or location to raise
        money for WE Create Change.
        </li>
    <li>Connect with your online
        community by organizing an
        online coin drive. Set up a
        fundraising page to keep track
        of your growing donations.</li>
</ul>

<p22>Reasons to Donate</p22>
<ul class = "d">
    <li>The knowledge of knowing that your donation has positively impacted someone's life will be enpowering for you, which'll make you feel more enpowered and fulfilled.</li>
    <li>Donating makes you a role model and leaders, which'll encourage others to step us and take impactful actions.</li>
    <li>Your donation motivates and drives our intiatives, and each small donation is always used towards helping others. Never believe that your donation is too small to create a change.</li>
    <li>Spread your gratefulness to others through shares and donations. Just because we are born in developed countries with a vast amount of opportunities, we should help those in developing countries.</li>
    <li>Through donating, you'll also be entilted to tax benefits and deductions. Instead of giving your hard-earned money only to the government, you can use it towards a great cause of supporting others.</li>
    <li>Donating isn't the only way to help. Sharing our socials including our website is equivalent because our intiative will be reached by countless individuals. Contact us @aleezacan42@gmail.com for more info on how you can help our intiative.</li>
